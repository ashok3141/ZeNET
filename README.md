ZeNET is a class library for .NET, to be pronounced similarly to "zenith".

It contains, and will accumulate over time, an assortment of tools that will
typically depend only on other classes in their own namespaces and on a core
namespace. The present focus of the library is on synchronization (across
threads), collections, and text processing.

The library aims to be backward-compatible up to .NET Framework 2.0 and to be
usable in hosted environments such as Microsoft SQL Server. At a minimum, the
Core namespace will always be backward-compatible.

The library is made available under the MIT license, which makes it free of
charge and imposes almost no restrictions on its use. The text may be found in
the LICENSE file. Even the condition that "[t]he above copyright notice and this
permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the
Software" can be waived upon special request.

Feedback on any aspect of the code or any part of the documentation will be
much appreciated.
